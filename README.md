## About The Project  
The name itself speaks for this simple yet fun project- "Doodling in Air". You pick up a marker (orange coloured for this project) and just move it in the air. It's that simple. A random word will also be displayed on the top, everytime you run the code, to give you an quick idea on what you can make. You can choose between colors and also there is a virtual option to clear the screen.
