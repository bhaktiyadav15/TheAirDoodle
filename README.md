Hack APAC project

## About The Project  
The name is enough to get the idea of this simple yet fun project. Doodling in Air. You pick up a marker (orange in this project) and just move it in the air. A random word will also be displayed everytime you run the code to give you an idea of what you can make. You can also choose between colors. There is a virtual option to clear to the screen.
